#### Building ####

To build this program, use command "make all"

To load required modules:

  module load Langs/Intel/15; module load Langs/Intel/15 MPI/OpenMPI/1.8.6-intel15

#### Running ####

Usage: ./parallel [n] [m] [width] [height] [num] [denom]

     - num/denom is the mutation likelihood
     - width and height are the torus dimensions


Run ./data.sh, ./randomness.sh, or ./scale.sh to get the data I used in my report.
Note that even though I use seeds, the results won't perfectly match because of the
ordering in which different processors call rand().

#### Code structure ####

Most of the logic is in parallel.c, although the heuristic approximation and the
utility functions are all in util.c and util.h.
